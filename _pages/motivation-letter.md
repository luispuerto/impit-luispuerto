Dear Madam or Sir, 

I am very excited of applying to International Master's Degree Programme in Information Technology (IMPIT) offered at the University of Eastern of Finland (UEF). My background is in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) where I have both formal education and working experience. In the past, most of my work has heavily relayed in computer science, programming and big data and I am very excited about the possibility of continue working on those fields.

The main reason why I am interested in the IMPIT program is because I see enormous synergies between the fields of computer sciences, natural and forestry sciences. We are heading for a moment in history when data is not going to be scarce anymore since the world is filling up rapidly with sensors, cameras, detectors and an unimaginable collection of data providing devices. The amount of data available is increasing each year, and sometimes is even stacking. All that data means nothing if we cannot use, analyze and even squeeze it, until it tells the truth about the universe where we live in. I want to be part of the algorithms and data analysis revolution, extracting the information required to find answers to questions that will help society to move forward. 

During my professional and academic experience, I have come to realize that most professionals working in the field, lack the foundational set of skills in computer and data science to perform their work in an optimal manner. I would like to gain the necessary proficiency in computer and data science to perform all those tasks in the optimal way and bring the benefits of the computer science workflows and tools to the analysis of data in the forestry and natural sciences. I am also very excited about the possibility of continue doing research and to further developed research related activities. Therefore and more specifically, I look forward to expand my knowledge in statistics, data science, data mining and machine learning topics. 

Besides a profesional and an academic interests, I have a personal curiosity in computer science related issues. In the recent years I have developed an increasing interest in programing and I self-learned languages such R, Windows Batch and Unix Shell scripting. I also learned how to use version control systems like Git, manage a small network of servers composed by Raspberry Pis or help in maintaining a GIS specialized tap for the macOS’ package manager Homebrew. I also developed my own —and my wive’s— website using the static website engine Jekyll using HTML, CSS and Liquid Template Language. 

Another important aspect that motivates me to apply to this program is its international orientation. I left Spain more than 5 years ago looking to expand my mindset by meeting people from all across the globe, see the world and have an international experience. And last but not least, I would like to also mention that I’m perfectly adapted to the Finnish life. I really love its forest, landscapes and Finnish nature. During the five years I’ve been here, I’ve discovered amazing places like Koli or Urho Kekonen National Parks, learned to appreciate quietness and fallen in love with sauna.  

You can know more about my application in [impit.luispuerto.net](http://impit.luispuerto.net). 

Sincerely yours,
