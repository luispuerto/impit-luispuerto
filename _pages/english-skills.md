Here, I would like to expand and explain a little bit about my English proficiency.  

## History

Before I moved to Sweden in 2013 I never lived in a foreign country in my life and it was for me the first real international experience, to which I was really looking forward. While living and working in Spain, I had regular contact with internationals, either during college, with Erasmus students who I helped as a student representative, or during my period at [CIUDEN](http://ciuden.es) where we had a handful of international workers from our outsourced projects. Even some of them were Finnish and we are still friends and in contact. Most of those interactions where in English, in an imperfect English, but things worked out. 

I always new I wanted to have an international experience, and for that reason I had as much contact with internationals as I could. I knew also that at some point I would need to prove my English proficiency. Therefore, during 2012 improve my English proficiency working myself in the language, using books, online resources and a little help from a Canadian native, and before I left to Sweden I got a score of [87 points](/assets/docs/Certificate-TOEFL-Previous.pdf).  

## Official exams

When I was about to leave to Sweden in 2013 I learned about the [iGEON Master Program](https://www.igeon.eu) and I decided to apply, but my TOEFL level was not enough at that moment for enter the master. They asked for a overall score of 92 and at least in writing 20. I already had the 20 points needed in writing, but my 87 points of overall score were not enough. I took the exam in May again and I got [96 points](/assets/docs/Certificate-TOEFL-Last.pdf) of overall score, but this time I got 18 points in writing —because I decided to start over again my essay in the middle of the writing section since I did not like were I was heading with it. Yet, I the admissions office of the Lund University considered that the two exams were complementary and they took the better scores from both. 

## UEF Internship

Short after we arrived to Finland I started to attend intensive language courses provided by the unemployment office and those courses also had a practical part, an internship in a Finnish company or institution. I decided to use that internship not only to practice my Finnish but also to learn professionally about Finnish forest, so I decided to go to [Metsäkeskus](https://www.metsakeskus.fi/) in the first place where I learned more about how Finnish forest is manage and I practiced my Finnish. 

However, in the following two courses and its internships I decided that besides of practice my Finnish I wanted to learn more about the last techniques the UEF was using to analyze LiDAR data. For that reason, I did two internships at UEF's at School of Forest Sciences at the department of Forest Mensuration and Planning. One in [2015](/assets/docs/UEF-Internship/UEF-Internship-01.pdf) and the other in [2016](/assets/docs/UEF-Internship/UEF-Internship-02.pdf), each one of a duration of about 2 months[^1]. After than, and due to the good result of the two first periods I decided to have a third internship thought a program from the employment office, divided in two periods. One from [beginning of September to the end of November 2016](/assets/docs/UEF-Internship/UEF-Internship-03.pdf) and from [January 2017 to the end of March](/assets/docs/UEF-Internship/UEF-Internship-04.pdf). 

I summed up in total around 9 months of internship work at the UEF. While in the first two, part of the aim was to practice Finnish, which I did with some of my coworkers, the work I was doing was technical and it needed to be discussed in English. During the second two periods the work was held entirely in English, like in any other research environment.  

## Master of Science in Sweden

As I explained above in 2013 in enrolled in an online Master of Science I am taking from Lund University in Sweden, [which is taught in English](/assets/docs/iGEON-certificate.pdf), the [iGEON program](https://www.igeon.eu). I have been enrolled in this master since 2013 and I have been taking courses on my free time. Mainly when I have not been enrolled in a Finnish Language courses, doing the internships or traveling. 

## Trip to the US

After my internships at the UEF I have the luck to travel to the US Pacific Northwest where I was living 5 months during 2017 in Corvallis, OR. During that period I volunteered in a cultural project and interact with researchers from the US Forest Service and the Oregon State University on a regular basis. Not to mention that, since I was not living alone, I was lucky to interact lengthly with regular Americans whom I have long conversations often during my spare time. 

## Sample of work

As a sample of work in English and as proof that I'm able to communicate fluently in English you can take a look to [my blog](https://luispuerto.net/blog/) where I write in English since 2017 and have more than 50 posts. 

In a more formal setting, I can mention that during part of my internship at the UEF I was working on a scientific paper with the title *Estimation of forest biomass components using airborne LiDAR and multispectral sensors* which is going to be published in the iForest journal (in print). I cannot provide at this moment any DOI or link to the published paper since the editor have not provide us with one yet. I will try to update this section and the one about [documentation](/documentation/#english--research-skills) as soon I am provided with more information.

- Hernando A., Puerto L., Mola-Yudego B., Manzanera J.A., Garcia-Abril A., Maltamo M., Valbuena R. 2019. *Estimation of forest biomass components using airborne LiDAR and multispectral sensors*. [iForest Journal](https://iforest.sisef.org) (In print).

## Present & Future

I know that my English is not perfect, but I have more than enough working and research/academic proficiency. I consider myself bilingual and nowadays I use much more English in my daily life than I do Spanish, which is my mother tongue. It's something that have been going on for the last five years of my life and I hope it will continue. 

I know also that I never going to speak like a native. I can be close, but probably never as a native. Anyhow, I work everyday to improve my English and try to make myself more understandable and fluid when I speak. For me, English is a tool that allow me to talk and listen to almost the entire world and make me to understand it better. 



[^1]: In the documents the duration is less than two months, but I was allowed to extend the internship period until more or less the end of the course since the work I was doing was interesting for me.
