In this section you can find all the documentation filed for my master application. I decided to create this section to explain some of the documents in detail. 

Documents have been sanitized for privacy and security reasons. Originals can be check on the official application.  

## Academic related documents

I hold since 2012 a **[Bachelor Degree in Forestry and Environmental Engineering of 240 ETCS](http://www.eiaf.unileon.es/eg_grado-en-ing-forestal-y-del-medio-natural/)** credits from the [University of León](https://www.unileon.es). I reached that diploma, first graduating in 2008 from what at that moment in Spain was called *[Technical Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_technician)* in Forestry —and translated into English as Bachelor of Agricultural Engineering (Forestry)— consisting in 3 years of study and 180 ETCS. Later on, and after being working for a while, I took a conversion program consisting in one additional year and 60 ETCS to transform my studies into the new European Bolonia framework.
